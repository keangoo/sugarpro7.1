         * falsely warn the user. This sets the model back to those changed attributes (causing them to
         * show up in this.model.changed) then calls the parent cancelClicked function which does the
         * exact same thing, but that time, since the model was already set, it doesn't see anything in
         * this.model.changed, so it doesn't warn the user.
